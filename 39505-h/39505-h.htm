<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>"With the New Year," says a Baronite, "there is a great
desire to turn over a new leaf." Such intentions are easily satisfied
by the <i>Back-Loop Pocket Diaries</i>, where leaves for this purpose
are plentifully supplied by <span class="sc">John Walker &amp; Co</span>. Likewise <span class="sc">De La
Rue &amp; Co.</span> offer Diaries and Memorandum Books in every size and
form, and this year they have a patent clip to keep the leaf down.
Ought to be advertised as "clipping!"</p>

<p>The Baron's Baronites look into a box of Christmas books and find,
first&mdash;<i>Westward with Columbus</i>. By <span class="sc">Gordon Stables</span>, M.D.C.M.
Graphic account. "<span class="sc">Stables</span> must have been in excellent form
when writing this," observes a Baronite; "evidently he was not
Livery Stables."&mdash;<i>Wreck of the Golden Fleece.</i> By <span class="sc">Robert
Leighton</span>. A capital sea story, plenty of rocks and wrecks,
hardships and plague-ships, and all sorts of wonderful adventures.&mdash;<i>The
White Conquerors of Mexico</i>, by <span class="sc">Kirk Munroe</span>, tells how
<span class="sc">Cortes</span> and his Spaniards, being white, did <span class="sc">Montezuma</span> and his
Aztic natives brown.&mdash;<i>With the Sea Kings.</i> <span class="sc">F. H. Winder.</span> The
youthful amateur salt will find everything here to satisfy all his
cravings and <i>See-kings</i>. "<i>Winder</i> has taken great <i>panes</i> with
this," says Baronitess.</p>

<p>"My clients," quoth the Baron, "will do well to read <span class="sc">Baring-Gould's</span>
cheap <i>Jack Zita</i>." Fascinating book by reason of its
picturesque effects and its description of life in the Fens at the
commencement of the present century. "I wonder," muses the
Baron, "whether any of my readers, being Cantabs, will call to mind
how some thirty-five years ago the names of those eminent amateur
pugilists <span class="sc">J-ck Sh-ff-ld</span>, <span class="sc">F-rg-ss-n D-v-e</span>, <span class="sc">L-nn-x
C-nn-ngh-m</span>, and others were associated with life in the Fens as it existed at that
time, and how these pupils of <span class="sc">Nat Langham's</span> now and again
disputed the championship of a certain Fen Tavern, won it, and
for a time held it? Some undergraduates were hand and glove
with the Fenners&mdash;not the cricket-ground, so styled, but the
dwellers in Fen-land; and on occasion they were hand to hand without
the 'glove.'" Why this question? "Because," says the Baron,
"one of the scenes so graphically described in the chapter, headed
'Burnt Hats,' might have been witnessed at the time I have
referred to by any undergraduate sufficiently venturesome to accompany
those fisticuffers." As for the plot, well, 'tis a good plot, and
has always been a good plot, and "twill serve, 'twill serve." But
it is the <span class="sc">Baring-Gould</span> flavouring that makes the dish acceptable to
the jaded palate of oldest novel-devourer.</p>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, Mr. <span class="sc">Caine</span>, for this relief much thanks.</p>
<p>As most benignant benefactor ranks</p>
<p>The man who saves our own sweet countryside&mdash;</p>
<p>At once our chiefest glory and our pride&mdash;</p>
<p>From all the many nauseating ills</p>
<p>Which come out of advertisements of pills!</p>
<p>Pills there must be, but when we chance to pass</p>
<p>Through meadows and would rest our eyes on grass,</p>
<p>Or pleasantly meander by the river,</p>
<p>We would forget we've even got a liver.</p>
<p>So here's success to you, Sir, in your Bill</p>
<p>To make it wrong to advertise a pill</p>
<p>In rural spots in which we fondly now</p>
<p>Associate "three acres and a cow!"</p>
<p>And when success this rural venture yields,</p>
<p>Do for the beaches what's done for the fields!</p>

["The leader of the Opposition had treated them
to good logic, but why administer such strong
meat to the babes on the Treasury bench?"&mdash;<i>Mr.
Courtney on the Parish Councils Bill.</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>We have heard of the Babes in the Wood,</p>
<p class="i2">And the ruffians greedy and cruel,</p>
<p>Who (as <span class="sc">Ingoldsby</span> said in gay mood)</p>
<p class="i2">Conspired for to "give them their gruel";</p>

<p>They find Doctor <span class="sc">Balfour</span>, one fears,</p>
<p class="i2">Worse than poor <i>Davy Copperfield's Creakle</i>;</p>
<p>As awful as grim <i>Mrs. Squeers</i></p>
<p class="i2">With her jorum of brimstone and treacle.</p>
<p>Ah, <span class="sc">Courtney</span>, how <i>could</i> you conceive</p>
<p class="i2">A picture so Mephistophelian?</p>
<p>Your buzzum is stone, I believe,</p>
<p class="i2">And your heart must be truly a steely 'un!</p>

<p>Strong meat? How your irony <i>you</i> barb,</p>
<p class="i2">Your humour's as grim as the gallows.</p>
<p>Your dose is as drastic as rhubarb,</p>
<p class="i2">And almost as bitter as aloes.</p>
<p>Logic? For Babes? On that Bench?</p>
<p class="i2">You're as hard as the Poles' "whiskered pandour."</p>
<p>You might as well set out to drench</p>
<p class="i2">Your own Opposition with&mdash;candour!</p>
<p>The Treasury Babes may object</p>
<p class="i2">To prescriptions from <span class="sc">Mill</span> or from <span class="sc">Whewell</span>,</p>
<p>And logical draughts, I expect,</p>

<p>How soon both would lay on the shelf</p>
<p class="i2">This prescription, and try quite another!</p>
<p>No; Reason, as party-strife goes,</p>

was mistaken&mdash;isn't that enough?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> Don't judge me by what you saw of <span class="sc">Walter Wildfire</span>.
I can do better things than that. I can make you forget <i>him</i>&mdash;forget
that he ever existed, if only you will trust me!</p>

<p><i>Alth. (indignantly).</i> Do you really suppose that he&mdash;that I&mdash;oh, it's
<i>too</i> insulting! And you will do no good by disparaging <i>him</i>. The
man who could write those songs, and sing them like that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Curph. (wincing).</i> Don't! I know how they must have struck
you. I would have prepared you, if I could. I <i>did</i> try&mdash;that afternoon
at the station, but I was interrupted. And now it's too late,
and the harm's done. But at least you
will never see <span class="sc">Walter Wildfire</span> again!</p>

<p><i>Alth. (exasperated).</i> Have I ever said
that I <i>wanted</i> to? Why will you persist
in talking as if&mdash;&mdash;? Once for all,
I <i>can't</i> care for you; whatever I may
have thought once, I know now that
I can have no sympathy with the sort
of life you lead; the pleasures you are
content with would not satisfy me; I
should want more than you could ever
give me. We should have nothing in
common&mdash;nothing&mdash;&mdash;There, <i>now</i> do
you understand?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> Yes, I think I do. I suppose
it's natural, and yet&mdash;don't think too
hardly of me if you can help it. I might
have chosen a higher walk than I did,
but at least I've kept out of the mire,
and now at last I see my way to&mdash;&mdash;But
that wouldn't interest you. There,
I had better say good-bye: you won't
refuse to give me your hand at parting,
will you?</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>As he takes her hand</i>, Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>

transfixed.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toovey.</i> <span class="sc">Althea</span>, don't tell me
I'm too late! You have not accepted
that man?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>releasing</i> <span class="sc">Althea's</span> <i>hand</i>).
On the contrary, I have just had my
dismissal, Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>; we were merely
saying good-bye.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Thank Heaven! But I
knew I could trust <i>my</i> daughter to
detect instinctively the designing serpent
in wolf's clothing&mdash;(<i>correcting herself
angrily</i>)&mdash;the sheep in dove's plumage,
I <i>should</i> say.</p>

<p><i>Charles (sotto voce).</i> Similes are cheap
to-day!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov. (more angrily still).</i> Well,
<i>I</i> know what I mean, and so does he!
(Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> <i>enters</i>.) And how a person with Mr.
<span class="sc">Curphew's</span>
antecedents could ever have the face to thrust himself into such a
household as this&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov. (coming forward).</i> <span class="sc">Cornelia</span>, my love! Such language
to our dear young friend! Surely, surely, there must be some sad
mistake!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> There has been indeed, Pa, and so you will say when
you hear who and what he really is!</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> has been quite aware of it for the last week,
and was kind enough to say he saw no insuperable objection.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Pa, is this true? You knew who Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> was
and never told me!</p>

<p><i>Mr Toov.</i> My dear, I've no more notion who he is, if he's not
Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>, than a babe un&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> But surely, Sir, you forget our conversation at Clapham
Junction this day week? You certainly knew everything <i>then</i>. I
thought your nephew had probably&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I'd no idea of it myself till last Saturday, so it couldn't
have been <i>me</i>!</p>

<p><i>Alth. (impatiently).</i> No idea of <i>what</i>? Who <i>is</i> Mr.
<span class="sc">Curphew</span>,
Papa?</p>

<p><i>Curph. (to her, in astonishment).</i> But you know! surely you
know? What else have we been talking about?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov. (helplessly).</i> I think we might try to be a little more
clear, all of us. I do indeed. I'm in a perfect fog myself.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Then, Pa, let me inform you that you have been
encouraging the acquaintance of a person who gains his living by
singing ribald songs at music-halls under the name of <span class="sc">Walter
Wildfire</span>!</p>

<p><i>Alth. (to herself).</i> <span class="sc">Walter Wildfire</span>! Then it was&mdash;&mdash;Oh, if
I had known!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> A&mdash;a music-hall singer! He! Oh, dear, <i>dear</i> me;
<i>how</i> one may be deceived in people!</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> Really, Sir, this can hardly be news to you, when you
allowed me to send you a box for the Eldorado for the express
purpose of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Don't deny you were sent the box, Pa, because I
know better. The question is&mdash;what you wanted one at all for?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov. (to himself).</i> There's no occasion to say anything
about those shares now! (<i>Aloud.</i>) To be sure. I <i>was</i> sent a ticket,
my love; I could not help that, but (<i>drawing himself up</i>) it was not
likely that I should compromise myself by visiting such a place,
even from the best of motives, and I did
not use the ticket myself, though I
believe some other person did.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov. (in some distress).</i> Well,
well, never mind that now, Pa. What
<i>you</i> have to do is to ask this Mr. <span class="sc">Wildfire</span>
to oblige us all by walking out of
this house&mdash;for ever.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> I should not have stayed so
long as this, only I hoped that Mr.
<span class="sc">Toovey</span> at least would have done me the
justice&mdash;&mdash; However, I've nothing to
keep me here any longer now.</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>He moves towards the door.</i></p>

<p><i>Alth. (coming forward and intercepting
him).</i> Yes, you have&mdash;you've

he can hold a mixed crowd of careless

them laugh, cry, shudder, just as he
chooses, and whatever he does is all so
natural and human and real, and&mdash;oh,

<h3 class="sans">LOBENGULA'S LETTER-BAG.</h3>

<p>(<i>Post-mark, Regent's Park</i>.)
Shall be glad to engage you for
the Gardens. You will be expected
to look after the elephants
and to make yourself generally
useful with the lions and tigers.
As the Christmas holidays are
approaching, perhaps you might
invent a little comic scene with
the crocodiles. A similar feature
was supplied years ago by the
French sailor in charge of the
seals with much effect. Of course
we shall be glad if your knowledge
of the idiosyncrasies of the
ourang-outang enables you to
suggest anything that could be
worked up into a comic interlude.
Please bear in mind that the
Gardens want waking up, and
you have a big opportunity. You would have Sunday off every
other week. The Gardens would reserve to themselves the right of
regulating your costume. Your boots and straw-hat may be ample
in Africa, but in the Regent's Park would be considered inappropriate.
We think we can clothe you in the very thing, if we
can find a size large enough for you. It is called "the boy's
home-for-the-holidays
lounging suit," and is largely advertised. Shall
expect you by next boat.</p>

<p>(<i>Post-mark, Westminster</i>). Glad to engage you for a month
certain, with power to increase the time to six weeks or longer. Could
you bring with you a pugilistic hippopotamus? It must be a young
one, as there is not much room for any side-shows. If you can
jump, and don't mind water, so much the better. If you would leap
from the organ-loft into a tank on to the stage, carrying on your
back the boxing-kangaroo, the feat might be accepted, and prove a
feature. Think this over on the journey to England. Perhaps something
may occur to you. If so, mind that we are deeply respected, and
are highly popular with the L. C. C. So please let your suggestions
be as refined as possible.</p>

<p>(<i>Post-mark, Paternoster Row</i>). Shall be glad to arrange with you
for the immediate production of your Recollections. Would be glad
if they were written in a bright, chatty style. You might give an
account of your connection with literary celebrities, torturers,
scientific expeditions, executions, sport in the far East, native war,
and other topics of interest that may have come under your personal
observation. If you could write up to some electros we have of a
comic German Christmas party so much the better. As the success
of the book is doubtful, we do not wish to incur unnecessary
expense, and therefore would be glad if you could see your way to
introducing the following blocks, of which we hold the copyright:&mdash;Covent
Garden by Moonlight, A Spanish Bull Fight, An Execution
in front of the Old Bailey, A Students' Ball in the Quartier Latin,
H.R.H. opening a Newly-erected Board-School, Snipe Shooting on
the Norfolk Broads, Christmas in a Storm at Sea, Hampstead Heath on
Bank Holiday, Portrait of <span class="sc">John Wesley</span>, A Lecture on Chemistry
at the Royal Polytechnic Institution, Exterior of the new Police
Court at Bow Street, An Incident in the Lord Mayor's Show,
"Oxford wins," <span class="sc">Van Tromp</span> sailing up the Thames, Paris Fashions
for February, Christmas Eve&mdash;the Last Omnibus, Hop Pickers on
the March, The new Uniform of the Grenadier Guards, and the late
Fire at the Borough Brewery. We shall be glad if you will put the
book in hand at once, as it is scarcely necessary to say that the sale
of a work of reminiscences depends to a large extent upon the
popularity of its author at the moment of publication. Terms,
after the sale of 5000 copies, one penny a volume royalty.</p>

<p>(<i>Post-mark, Drury Lane.</i>) Engage you at once for ten years.
Probably shall not require you for more than three or four months,
but shall retain you for the rest of the time. May come in useful
later on. Place waiting for you in the Pantomime. Minute and a
half in English History in twenty minutes. Also comic scene with
the Clown. The engagement must have clause allowing transference.
Can find places for your wives (if they are really nice
ones) in the Transformation Scene. If you can imitate the
cries &amp;c., of wild beasts, &amp;c., think I can get you a turn at the
Palace. Writing a first-rate
part for you in Autumn drama.
A sort of gentlemanly demon,
who appears in the West End
during the first and third Acts,
and in the last scene, appears
in national costume with a real
army and the whole bag of
tricks. Bring as many of your
army with you as you can. Can
find something for them to do until
the production of the Autumn
drama. Collect a good lot of
assegais and other useful props.
May see way to working you
into the Opera season. If you
can sing, can give you a show
at a concert. Might do for
German series. Terms as per
usual. Special arrangement if
wanted at Windsor. Come over
at once. On second thoughts,
remain where you are. Will run
over to have a chat. Third, and
last thought, come over yourself.
Find myself, with my engagements,
just now a little pressed
for time. <i>Au revoir!</i></p>

<h2>"HISTORY (NEARLY) REPEATS ITSELF."</h2>

<h4>(<i>A Peep into the Future.</i>)</h4>

<p>There was a general strike. The playing fields were deserted,
and trade was at a standstill. Not a cricket-ball or a foot-ball had
been made for months, and the lawn-tennis industry
was paralyzed. The papers of the day urged the
Government to intervene. "After all, it was only a
matter of figures. Surely a compromise might be
reached. If players would only meet payers, all
would be well." So a Cabinet Council was held, and
the most popular Member of the Ministry was selected
as arbitrator. The name was well-received by both
sides, and all seemed <i>en train</i> for a satisfactory
settlement.</p>

<p>"We must have a proper salary," said a representative
of the foot-ball profession: "if we don't,
we shall have to give it up, and take to soldiering,
doctoring, brief-accepting, and the rest of it."</p>

<p>There was a murmur of disapproval at this
suggestion. Was foot-ball to perish because its
professors could not get a "living wage"? No, a
thousand times no!</p>

<p>Then the Minister suggested that he had better
hear the complaints of the men, the women, and the
children. So the cricketers, the golfers, the polo-players,
and the lovers of lawn-tennis spoke at length.</p>

<p>"And what may you want young lady?" asked
the arbitrator, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I must be paid for taking my doll for a walk,"
replied a small girl of six or seven. "I have to
keep the toy perambulator in repair, and when
Rose falls on her nose, I have to get her face
replaced. How am I to bear these expenses if I
receive nothing? It is impossible, unreasonable!"</p>

<p>"And I, too," cried a schoolboy. "How can I
trundle my hoop or play at marbles if I am not
allowed something for my time?"</p>

<p>And there were other complaints. Everyone wanted a wage, and
the cries for salaries waxed louder and louder.</p>

<p>Then the Minister asked for a few minutes' grace, and began
writing. After he had finished his despatch, he put it in an
envelope, and requested someone to read it when he had taken his
departure. Then he went away.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the person to whom the
despatch had been entrusted. "This is highly unsatisfactory.
I find the arbitrator has resigned
without making an award, and has left the matter in
the hands of Lord <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>."</p>

<p>Then there was a cry of sorrow. For it was
known that as Lord <span class="sc">Rosebery</span> had had quite enough
of conflicts between capital and labour, he would
certainly refuse to be dragged into another quarrel.</p>

<p>So the war went on between players and payers,
and "Merrie England" became a byword of reproach
in the comity of nations.</p>

<p class="center">Johnson of Ballykilbeg escorting the Duke of York.</p></div>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, November
20.</i>&mdash;Rumour current to-night that
Ballykilbeg is in the market. Ballykilbeg is
the manorial seat of one of the most ancient
and honourable Irish families, long settled in
County Down. The <span class="sc">O'Hnstons</span> were in the
train of <span class="sc">Borrhoimi</span> when he first essayed,
and succeeded in, the difficult task of forming
a United Ireland. <span class="sc">Jake O'Hnston</span> is a
name that lingers lovingly in tradition of
Youngest Ireland. Gradually, being always
on the people's lips, it began to take a new
form. <span class="sc">J. O'Hnston</span> naturally became <span class="sc">Johnston</span>;
but Ballykilbeg was always there.
To-day House of Commons contains no more
esteemed Member than he who is known as
<span class="sc">Johnston</span> of Ballykilbeg. A man of war
breathing battle, ever ready to take his place
amongst the corpses in the last ditch, <span class="sc">Johnston</span>
of Ballykilbeg off the platform in Ulster,
or off his legs in House of Commons, is the
mildest-mannered man that ever proposed
to broil a brother for conscience' sake.</p>

<p>Quite a sensation at prospect of dissevering
<span class="sc">Johnston</span> from Ballykilbeg. Glad to hear
there's nothing, or little, in it. Arises out
of circumstance that <span class="sc">Johnston</span> has approached
Mr. G. with suggestion that
Treasury shall purchase an estate in Ireland,
and there plant out the Duke of <span class="sc">York</span>.
If the Duke, making a survey of Ireland,
should find no more attractive place
than Ballykilbeg, the descendant of the
<span class="sc">O'Hnstons</span> is not the man to allow personal
predilections or old associations to stand in the way of gratification
of Royal desire. It might come to pass that the Crowned Heads of
Europe would welcome at their courts <span class="sc">York</span> of Ballykilbeg, whilst
the last of the <span class="sc">O'Hnstons</span> would be content to house his loyal head
under alien roof. That, however, not a prospect in view when he
moved in the matter. There is surely room between the seas
that circle Ireland for the Duke of <span class="sc">York</span> and <span class="sc">Johnston</span> still at
Ballykilbeg.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Parish Councils on again. That was order of day,
but human ingenuity dragged in other matters. First Woman's
Suffrage, on which there was livelier debate than has yet arisen in
Committee on this Bill. Last Thursday <span class="sc">Walter M'Laren</span> raised
question in form of an Instruction. Government resisting were
beaten, the Opposition coalescing with revolting Radicals. Now, as
<span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> puts it, the Government, kissing the rod,
accept injunction; undertake to embody <span class="sc">M'Laren's</span> Amendment in
Bill. Pretty to see air of doubt and hesitation that hereupon comes
over ingenuous faces on Opposition benches. If <span class="sc">Henry Fowler</span>
had put his back up, declared that Woman delighted him not, nor
<span class="sc">Walter M'Laren</span> either, Opposition would again have joined
forces with Radicals, and Government would once more have suffered
defeat. Since they resolved to obey Instruction carried by majority
last Thursday, <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> shakes his head; <span class="sc">Edward Stanhope</span>
shows this is quite another pair of sleeves; whilst <span class="sc">Joseph</span>, back
bronzed from breezy Bahamas, bluntly says he will oppose new
Clause <span class="sc">Henry Fowler</span> has promised to bring in.</p>

<p>"It is the duty of an Opposition to oppose," says <span class="sc">Prince
Arthur</span>; "and I did not for several Sessions sit at feet of <span class="sc">Old
Morality</span> without being impressed with imperative sense of duty."</p>

<p class="center">Mr. Courtney explains the Puzzle.</p></div>

<p>Later, when this difficulty temporarily out of way and it seemed
progress with Clause might be made. Proportional Representation
was dragged in neck and crop. <span class="sc">Courtney</span> took charge of the puzzle
business, and tried to explain it. No prizes offered, and attention a
little slack. <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> defined the theory in admirable
phrase. "It is," he said, "an ingenious system by which a man is
to vote for a person he does not prefer in order to secure a majority
for some purpose he does not understand." Can't better that;
leaves nothing else to say. Nevertheless, much was said; talked by
the hour; finally a division, in which Government majority, rarely
falling below three score and ten, stood at 72.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Something of the debating society order.</p>

<p><i>Thursday night.</i>&mdash;Things coming to a pretty pass if <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>
is not to offer a few observations on third reading of Employers'
Liability Bill without an arrogant Minister moving the Closure.
Apart from consideration of individual liberty and freedom of
speech, House would have suffered special disappointment if
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> had accepted <span class="sc">Asquith's</span> suggestion and submitted
question
of Closure. Finding <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> on his feet at this juncture it
naturally thought he had, in interval, discovered what his amendments
moved last week in Committee on Bill meant, and was seizing
this opportunity of explaining them. He didn't; but that was all
<span class="sc">Asquith's</span> fault. Enough to cow any man rising at ten minutes to
twelve and having pistol held to his head in shape of motion for the
Closure.</p>

<p>Just at the time when <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> was coming to his explanation,
hand of clock touched five minutes to twelve. He might still have
used up at least four minutes; being flurried, he sat down; and now
we shall never know what his amendments were designed to accomplish.
Happily there was time left for <span class="sc">Matthews</span> to soundly
rate <span class="sc">Asquith</span> for his attempt to Closure <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>. Right hon.
gentleman could scarcely control his tongue in the emotion under
which he laboured, in contemplation of the attempted outrage. It
would have been bad enough with an ordinary member. That the
weighty and sententious speech of so eminent a statesman as the
Member for Preston should have been broken in upon by a motion
for the Closure only showed, in the ex-Home Secretary's opinion,
how bad was the case of the Government, how reckless the
tactics to which desperation drove them. A beautiful speech;
almost, as <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> says, worth being snubbed by <span class="sc">Asquith</span> in
order to elicit this eloquent testimony to modest merit.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Employers' Liability Bill read a third time.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;Great advantage of habit of foreign travel ingrained

making it possible for Lovely Woman, whether married or single,
to stoop to folly of being elected on Parish Council Board. Up
jumps <span class="sc">Horace Plunkett</span> with some charming reminiscences brightly
told of residence in the State of Wyoming. In that happy land
women enjoy equal political and municipal privileges with their
brother men.</p>

<p>"I was," said <span class="sc">Plunkett</span>, "well acquainted with a female Justice

revolver."</p>

<p>Another of <span class="sc">Plunkett's</span> lady friends in far-off Wyoming had her
domestic duties broken in upon by summons to attend a jury. Case

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
